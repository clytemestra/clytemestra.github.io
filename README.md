This repository contains HTML and CSS files. Also included are a few image files. These files comprise the author's GitHub pages and serve as a learning and testing ground.

Among the files is a resume because it was the largest, most complex document suitable for the purpose and an About page because the author may or may not be a time traveller from 1998.
