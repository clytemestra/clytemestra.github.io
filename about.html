          <div class="info">
            <p>I am a middle-aged woman who goes by "Fred." I have a husband who codes and two cats who don't care.</p>

        <h3>Work</h3>
          <div class="info">
            <p>As a copyeditor and proofreader employed as a technical editor for an emergency management firm, I am more of a "technical" editor than a technical editor. This means that while I am a specialized editor, it's not a specialization in technology. On the other hand, my second job is working as a "copyeditor" for AWS blogs doing some pretty technical stuff. I also freelance, but that tends to be in the field of education.</p>

        <h3>Cats</h3>
          <div class="info">
            <p>Sasha and Isis are blissfully unaware of the digital activites of their humans. Sasha is a male tabby, and Isis is a female Lynx Point Siamese.</p>
