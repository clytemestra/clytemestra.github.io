        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I first learned HTML 20 years ago. Now I'm relearning it and adding a dash of CSS. Maybe more than a dash, we'll see.</p>
        <p>I'm a technical editor who wishes she had become a technical writer, but that requires the ability to write in abundance and with fluency.</p>
        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>Here is my <a href="resume.html">resume</a>.</p>
        <p>Here is my <a href="http://jennifermerchan.com">freelance editor site</a>.</p>
        <p>One of these, I made with HTML and CSS, the other was created on WordPress. I'm confident you can figure out which is which.</p>
