    <h3>Nausea</h3>
    <div class="info">
    <p>Waves of nausea crashed through the archivist like breakers at high tide. The culmination of all of her hard work at the archives hung in the balance. Sasha had been waiting ten years for this moment to come—and yet at ten years with the archives, she barely qualified to be considered for this opportunity.</p>
	<p>The director had pinged her while she was at her desk wrapping up her affairs before leaving for the day. Her face grew hot as an amorphous panic set in. But she took a deep breath and signaled her availability anyway. Almost immediately, the director's harsh face materialized on her screen.</p>
	<p>“Sasha,” he said, rushing straight to the point, “you've been selected. The next survey expedition has been approved to leave in six months, and you're on the team. Congratulations, you are the youngest archivist ever to win a position on a survey ship. We're counting on you to faithfully and diligently represent the guild.”</p>
	<p>Sasha took a gulp of air and found her vocal cords. “Director, does this mean the navigators guild approved my suggested destination planet?”</p>
	<p>“Yes, it does,” he replied. “But don't get your hopes up too high. After hundreds of survey missions, we still have yet to find any evidence of life.”</p>
	<p>The rest of the communication was a blur of pleasantries, caveats, and conditions that she would be hard-pressed to recall later, for in her nervousness, she forgot to activate her optics. Fortunately for her, the director also sent a text data packet immediately following the video comm that included the details she would need to prepare for the trip.</p>
	<p>The director was Joshua Martin, Director of the Communal Alean Archives, where Sasha Petrov had served first as an acolyte, then an assistant archivist, before becoming a full archivist, for the past ten years. She had applied for the prestigious position without a glimmer of hope that she might win it, for while her superiors acknowledged her work to be of the highest quality, she was still young and had no political connections.</p>
	<p>Faint with the gravity of the comm and its revelation, Sasha sat at her desk and stared blankly at the screen. She tried to calm her racing heart, breathing in deeply the musty smell of the rugs that furnished her small office. Somewhat steadied, she then opened the text packet. More data always helps, she thought. She switched on her optics and scanned the information with her silver eyes—eyes that exemplified the extent of her privilege as a fully vested archivist in this world of hereditary guilds and limited access to wondrous technology that had developed so far as to take her people out to the stars.</p>
	<p>She was privileged, yes, but not important. Why, she wondered, had she been chosen for so vital a role in a planetary survey mission. Indeed, every mission carried an archivist. The archivists, with their optics, played the roles of recorders of new discoveries and recounters of  historical moments. The archivists chosen for these missions were typically older, male, and well connected, a crowning achievement on a long career and a lifetime of research. So, while she met the requirements for the position on paper, she had absolutely no expectation of being chosen for a mission. She was also amazed that the navigators had accepted her chosen planet without question, though in truth, the archivist's choice was never disregarded.</p>
	<p>Sasha finished scanning the mission brief, sat back, and examined her office with new eyes. Maybe I'm not as inept as I thought, she mused. Or, maybe they made a mistake. The old demons came creeping back in just as her supervisor arrived at her door. Was she here to take it back? Had the director commed the wrong person and then sent her supervisor over to clear things up? The nausea returned.</p>

    <h3>Doubt</h3>
    <div class="info">
    <p>“Congratulations!” Isa shouted, her hands up in the air in an animated display of enthusiasm. Sasha was thankful that the office area had largely cleared out for the day already.</p>
	<p>“Thanks,” Sasha mumbled, a nervous scowl on her face. “So, it's real, then? I'm not hallucinating a comm from the director telling me I made the survey team?”</p>
	<p>“Absolutely not. You earned that spot. I recommended you, and my recommendations are never wrong,” Isa said with a grin. “Go, celebrate. No staying late at work for you tonight.”</p>
	<p>But staying late was exactly what Sasha wanted to do. All this talk of survey missions had resurrected the ghosts of ancient history and mythology that had haunted her mind since childhood. After so many years of first ridicule, then clandestine research in the archives, she was going out there, where, she heretically believed, it had all begun.</p>
	<p>Like all archivist survey mission candidates, Sasha had used her free time to scour the archives for evidence of a potentially habitable planet. The archives served as a storehouse for every scrap of knowledge produced by every guild on this world, going back hundreds of years, and so the archivists themselves were routinely tapped for both the knowledge they had accumulated and their uncanny ability to find whatever was sought. As a guild, the archives were their property, and there could be no other way. So, the archivists found planets, and the navigators plotted the courses.</p>
	<p>Sasha did not question the order of things, but she did question their origins, which was even more dangerous. According to everyone from the authors of the sacred texts to any man on the street, the people of Alea were entirely autochthonous. To say otherwise was heresy.</p>

    <h3>Heresy</h3>
    <div class="info">
    <p>Tonight, she wanted to revisit some of her previous research. As she stepped out of her office, she noted that the office area was indeed empty. Her footfalls echoed down the hallway that led to the main body of the archives, for while nearly all of the content of the archives lived in the massive bank of computers one floor down, the original physical devices and records were still preserved for posterity on the shelves of this hallowed building. This  she loved: digging deep in to the archives to find original records of historical significance, perhaps even finding records that previously escaped processing and entering them into the database for the first time. 
	But her goal tonight was not to register anything into the database but to surreptitiously revisit what she considered proof refuting the autochthonous theory of origin of the people of Alea—pictures found in what she eventually learned was once called a book.</p>
	<p>When she first came across it, she was told not to enter it into the database, as it was too cumbersome to image, and then she was warned to forget that she had ever found it. Still an acolyte at the time, Sasha obeyed but never forgot. It took years to find the item again, but she find it she did.</p>
	<p>Sasha climbed six flights of stairs to reach the furthest and oldest reaches of the archives. She paused at the stairwell exit to catch her breath and turn off her link before entering the archive itself. She palmed the security panel for permission to enter, and the door opened. There would be a record of her visiting this section of the archives, but her selection for the survey mission would serve as reason enough to do so. As for camera surveillance, there was none—the entire building was usually filled with people walking around with cameras in their eyes, plus the guild trusted their own.</p>
	<p>The carpet muted her steps as she strode past the rows of records toward the back wall. Despite her new latitude, Sasha felt like her insides had been replaced with jelly. Once she reached the wall, she turned right down an aisle filled with what one might mistake for junk if one were not an archivist. But here everything had its place and its purpose. And all the way at the end of the aisle, Sasha found her prize sealed in rotting cellophane.</p>
	<p>She pulled on a pair of gloves from her pocket and gingerly unwrapped it. Flakes of the transparent protective cover fell to the floor. She brushed them under the shelf with her shoe. The book itself had held up better than its covering. She brought the book to a nearby viewing station and placed it on the table. She carefully opened the book about midway in. Sasha held her breath for a moment, as if breathing on it might cause it to crumble to dust.</p> 
	<p>Sasha brought her face down to the level of the book and peered closely at the exposed pages. The images were still there; she hadn't imagined them. To the side of and sometimes underneath the images there was print, familiar, yet strange. The structures were simple and short, but in a language that seemed familiar but different. She wanted very badly to decipher it, but she couldn't do so in the time she had here in the archives, and even now, she didn't dare use her opticks to record the text and images lest someone review her records and see what she had found.</p>
	<p>But it wasn't the text that was damning. The images depicted a guild flag that she had never seen before, in person or in a record in the archives. There was what looked like an enforcers guild in strange uniforms marching through the streets. And oddest of all, there was a beast with a white head, a brown body, and large talons. But these fantastical images were lifelike, not illustrations. And the substance on which the these images and this text lay was the most fabulous aspect of all—some sort of cellulose of the finest quality, white and smooth underneath her fingers when she once touched it with an ungloved hand.</p>
	<p>Absorbed by the strange text, Sasha started at the sound of the door to the stairwell opening and then closing. It was a loud, metallic clang that always introduced a new visitor to the archives. Sasha immediately closed the book, quickly but noisily put it back in its wrapper, stripped off her gloves, and stuffed them back into her pocket. She ran back to the shelf and deposited the book back into its designated space. She then removed herself to the darkest, smallest corner she could find.</p>
	<p>“You were warned, Sasha.” A deep voice rose over the shelving. Sasha stood rooted to the spot in fear, her heart beating fiercely in her chest. “But you didn't listen,” the voice said, dragging out the sibilant in a hiss. Sasha could barely breathe.</p>
	<p>She heard heavy boots approaching her on the carpeting, rounding the corner of the aisle where she was hiding. “Now, you will pay the price,” said the voice, growing ever closer. Sasha could make out a tall, imposing, dark figure carrying something that reflected the dim light in its hands. Click-click. He has a gun, Sasha realized. And she collapsed to the floor in a dead faint.</p>
	<p>Sasha had never broken a bone in her body, but as she lay on the floor of the archives, she felt as if she had split her skull open. She sat up slowly and felt around with her shaking hands but found no evidence of any blood or of any skull-splitting. From the angle of the blow, she surmised that her head must have hit a shelf on the way down. But what had happened? Why was she still here? Where had the gunman gone? Had he just left her here without following through on his threat? Why? The book. Where was the book?</p> 
	<p>She raised herself to a standing position with unsteady limbs and peered over in the direction of her proof…which was gone.</p>
